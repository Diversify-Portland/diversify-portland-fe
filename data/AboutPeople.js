    text: `Hi Portland, I am Mss_Oregon. Mother to the other team members & a Portland native. I look forward to getting to know all that reachesMe out to us. The team and I have a serious mission to CHANGE the way Portland interacts socially. My personal goal is to give businesses,  individuals and families a safe place to talk about cultural differences and to create spaces that allow fellow Portlanders to mingle with those outside their normal social boxes. I believe that stepping out of your social comfort zone can open you up to new experiences while also helping you grow not just on a personal level but also in how we interact with others at work and in public places. I have been specializing in mediation and public speaking for over 15years & I look forward to sharing these expertise with you all. My favorite part about the work I do is curating events & watching people become friends with someone they never would of thought they'd be friends with. I also love creating strategic plans to help businesses become more diverse. I am a results driven person with a big heart for all humans.

~Together we can change the world~

My name is True and I'm 9 years old. My grade is now Fourth grade. What I want to be when I grow up is an actor because I watch television and It looks hard but fun to be an actor. There has recently been a lot of racism in Portland, Oregon, so I think that maybe we can change how it is and help with people realizing there’s so much more to people than just the color of their skin. Everybody is beautiful in their own ways. I can't wait to talk with other youth & create kid only parties!

    text: `My name is Klassic and I'm the third co-founder of the NCDAC & Diversify Portland. I’m 15 years old and I’m currently a sophomore at Parkrose High School. When I grow up I wanna be a Graphic designer. I chose this because I really like to design and create stuff digitally, like making shirts, pants or sweats, and even things like buttons. I want to help Portland by helping communicate the importance of diversity to the youth of Portland, especially because if the youth don’t get taught now then that could affect the generation of now and the future from now.
